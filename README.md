# portaDAC
portaDAC is a portable dac project that fits in your pocket, is light weight and self-powered. It will be designed for simplicity and a high-quality audio experience, with internal storage for local music or audio streaming.

The purpose of the project is to learn more about audio and electrical design. Simulation software will be used to decide on a suitable circuit design. portaDAC is also a product which we are personally interested in using!

# Requirements
Non-formal requirements to ensure that we have a clear goal for the project.

## Must-haves
- at least 12-hours of active battery life,
- light weight (<250 g),

- on / off switch,
- power indicator (on or off state),
- battery indicator,
- local storage >256 GB,
- 1x stereo audio output, 3.5 mm,
- mounting hole (cable, hanger, key chain, strap),
- has to look nice!


## Nice-to-haves
- 1x stereo audio output, 6.35 mm,

# Timeline (no pressure!!!)
- 27/4/25: first draft for schematics and simulation completed,
- 4/5/25: catch-up and revised schematics from feedback previous week,
- 11/5/25: first draft for layout completed
- 18/5/25: catch-up and revised layout from feedback previous week

** Be done before _27/7/25_ with complete design, assembly and testing. (and mass production >:)... ) **
